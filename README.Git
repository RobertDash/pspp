Prerequisites for Building PSPP from Git
----------------------------------------

To build this project from the sources direct from the Git archive,
you must install the prerequisites listed in README, plus the
following:

	* Autoconf 2.60 (or later).

	* Automake 1.10 (or later).

	* Gettext 0.17 (or later).

	* GNU M4 1.4.9 (or later).

	* pkg-config 0.21 (or later).

        * gperf 3.0.1 (or later).

	* Gnulib (see below for details).

	* libtool 1.5.22 (or later).

	* Texinfo 4.7 or later, to build the documentation.

After you install PSPP's prerequisites, you must obtain a copy of
Gnulib, then bootstrap the tree, as described in the sections below.
After that, you may follow the procedure described in INSTALL.

Obtaining Gnulib
----------------

This version of PSPP should work with the Gnulib commit shown below.
Gnulib does not maintain a stable API or ABI, so it is possible that
PSPP will not work with older or newer versions of Gnulib.


  commit 52a32bbd66601d12627e104cd82d9b9094d942c3
  Author: Bruno Haible <bruno@clisp.org>
  Date:   Fri Sep 24 14:36:26 2010 +0200

      unistr/u8-strchr: Fix a test failure on i586 glibc systems.
    
      * tests/unistr/test-strchr.h (test_strchr): Disable an invalid check.


To clone Gnulib into a directory named "gnulib" using Git, and then
check out this particular commit, run these commands:
	git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gnulib.git gnulib
	cd gnulib
	git checkout $COMMIT
where $COMMIT should be replaced by the commit number listed above
(usually it is sufficient to just type the first 6 or so digits).

If you do not have Git installed, then you may alternately download
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=snapshot;h=$COMMIT;sf=tgz
where $COMMIT is, again, at least the first few digits of the commit
number listed above.  This download will yield a tar.gz file that you
may extract with "gunzip" and "tar" to yield identical results.

Bootstrapping
-------------

Once you have Gnulib installed, PSPP must be "bootstrapped" using the
following command:
	make -f Smake
If you checked Gnulib out in a directory named `gnulib' at the same
level as PSPP, then this is sufficient.  Otherwise, provide the
location of GNULIB on the `make' command line:
	make -f Smake GNULIB=/gnulib/base/directory/name

After executing Smake, follow the procedure described in INSTALL to
build and install PSPP.  On some systems this may be as simple as:
	./configure
	make

Once PSPP is built, you may run its self-tests with:
	make check
or for a more thorough test:
	make distcheck
