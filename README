PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It
interprets commands in the SPSS language and produces tabular output
in ASCII or PostScript format.

PSPP development is ongoing. It already supports a large subset of
SPSS's transformation language.  Its statistical procedure support is
currently limited, but growing.

For information on differences from previous versions, please see file
NEWS.  Full documentation on PSPP's language can be found in the doc/
directory.
