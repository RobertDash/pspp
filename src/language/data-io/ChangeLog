	Continue reforming error message support.  In this phase, get rid
	of message "titles" and put the message text in `struct error'.
	Now `struct error' encapsulates a message more properly.
	
	* data-list.c: (macro RPD_ERR) Removed.
	(rpd_msg) New function.  Updated all references to tmsg() to call
	this function instead.

	Remove last users of struct file_ext so we can get rid of it
	entirely.
	
	* data-reader.c: (struct dfm_reader) Change file member from
	struct file_ext to FILE *.  Updated all references.
	(dfm_close_reader) Close file with fn_close() instead of
	fn_close_ext().  Also, make a copy of the file name from the file
	handle before closing it, because we can't extract it after we
	close the file.
	(dfm_open_reader) Open file with fn_open() instead of
	fn_open_ext().

	* data-writer.c: (struct dfm_writer) Change file member 
	struct file_ext to FILE *.  Updated all references.
	(dfm_close_writer) Close file with fn_close() instead of
	fn_close_ext().  Also, make a copy of the file name from the file
	handle before closing it, because we can't extract it after we
	close the file.
	(dfm_open_writer) Open file with fn_open() instead of
	fn_open_ext().

	* data-list.c: Add prototype to suppress warning for
	cmd_repeating_data().
