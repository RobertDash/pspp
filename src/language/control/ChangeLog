	Fix memory leaks.
	
	* repeat.c: (parse_ids) Take pool parameter and allocate all
	memory from pool.  Reduce implementation from loop to single call
	to parse_mixed_vars_pool().
	(store_numeric) Removed.
	(add_replacement) New function.
	(parse_numbers) Take pool parameter and allocate all memory from
	pool.  Require ranges to be in increasing order.
	(parse_strings) Take pool parameter and allocate all memory from
	pool.

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, get rid of
	many global variables, consolidating procedure execution in
	procedure.c.  Encapsulate transformations in new "struct
	trns_chain".  Also, change implementation of N OF CASES, FILTER,
	and PROCESS IF from special cases to transformations.
	 
	* do-if.c: (cmd_do_if) Use finalizer to ensure control stack gets
	cleared.
	(do_if_finalize_func) New function.

	* loop.c: (create_loop_trns) Use finalizer to ensure control stack gets
	cleared.
	(loop_trns_finalize) New function.

	* temporary.c: (global var temporary) Removed.  Changed references
	to use proc_make_temporary_transformations_permanent() or
	proc_in_temporary_transformations().
	(global var temp_dict) Removed.
	(global var temp_trns) Removed.
	(cmd_temporary) Reimplement in terms of
	proc_in_temporary_transformations() and
	proc_start_temporary_transformations().
	(cancel_temporary) Moved to procedure.c, renamed
	proc_cancel_temporary_transformations().
