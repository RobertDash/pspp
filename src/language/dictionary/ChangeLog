	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, get rid of
	the output code for SPLIT FILE groups in procedure.c, which really
	shouldn't be doing any output.  Move it into the individual
	procedures instead.  This also adds some flexibility.

	* split-file.c (output_split_file_values): New function.
