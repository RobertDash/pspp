	Output variable measurement level, alignment, and display width as
	part of DISPLAY DICTIONARY and SYSFILE INFO output.  Bug #13019.
	Reviewed by John Darrington.

	Adapt case sources, sinks, and clients of procedure code to the
	new infrastructure.

	* vector.c (cmd_vector): Add support for specifying an output
	format in the short form of the command, fixing bug #18706.
	Rewrite to get rid of weird data structure and simplify.

	* sys-file-info.c (display_vectors): For DISPLAY VECTORS, display,
	in addition to the names of vectors, the names, positions, and
	print formats of the variables contained in the vectors.

	used in system file.

	* variable-label.c: Move to src/data/variable.c.
	
	* vector.c (cmd_vector): Use PV_SAME_WIDTH in parse_variables
	call, because string variables in a vector must have the same
	width.

	* value-labels.c (get_label): Allow commas between values and
	labels and between value labels.  Fixes bug #18303.  Thanks to
	John Darrington for reporting this bug.

	Simplify parsing.

Wed Nov  1 20:50:54 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* sys-file-info.c: (cmd_display) Use compare_var_ptr_names to
	compare "struct variable **"s, not compare_var_names.  Fixes bug
	#17423.

	* apply-dictionary.c: (cmd_apply_dictionary) Use new function
	val_labs_can_set_width().

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, get rid of
	the output code for SPLIT FILE groups in procedure.c, which really
	shouldn't be doing any output.  Move it into the individual
	procedures instead.  This also adds some flexibility.

	* split-file.c (output_split_file_values): New function.

	* automake.mk (src_language_dictionary_libcmddict_a_SOURCES): Add
