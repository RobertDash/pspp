	* recode.c (enlarge_dst_widths): Source isn't null-terminated, so
	don't pretend it is.
	(var_is_num_missing): MISSING should include system-missing values
	too.

Thu Feb  1 16:51:16 2007  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* recode.c (find_src_numeric): Handle MAP_SYSMIS case, which was
	carelessly overlooked until now.  Fixes bug #18917.  Thanks to
	John Darrington for bug report and review.

Sat Dec  9 18:48:20 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* compute.c (struct compute_trns): Remove `fv' member, which was
	redundant with `variable'.

Thu Nov 30 22:46:50 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* compute.c: Fix bug #17422, which reports that a variable created
	by assignment in a COMPUTE command could not be used in the
	computation expression.
	(struct lvalue) Drop `var_name' member in favor of `variable'
	pointer.  Add `is_new_variable' member to allow us to know whether
	to delete the variable at destruction time, in case of an error.
	(lvalue_parse) Create variable whose name is specified, if it does
	not already exist, as a numeric variable.
	(lvalue_get_type) Rewrite to work with revised lvalue structure.
	New `dict' parameter, which propagates back up its call chain.
	(lvalue_finalize) No need to create variable here since we did so
	at parse time.
	(lvalue_destroy) Destroy variable if `is_new_variable' set.

	* automake.mk fail.c: Added a debug transformation which always fails.

Sat May  6 16:02:55 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Get rid of `char *c' member in union value, for cleanliness.

	* recode.c: (union recode_value) New union.
	(struct map_in) Change x, y types to union recode_value.
	(struct map_out) Change value type to union recode_value.
	(find_src_string) Wrap data_in() call so it uses a real `union
	value'.

Sat May  6 14:08:42 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* select-if.c (cmd_filter): Make FILTER without any further
	keywords turn off filtering, with a warning, for compatibility.
	Change errors from cascading failures to ordinary failures.  Check
	for command terminator.

Sat May  6 13:25:57 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, remove
	PROCESS IF, which was deprecated anyway and can be easily
	simulated with TEMPORARY followed by SELECT IF.

	* select-if.c (cmd_process_if): Removed.
	(global var process_if_expr) Removed, along with all references
	globally.

Tue Apr 25 13:23:25 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* select-if.c (cmd_process_if): Use SW instead of MW for warning
	associated with a syntax file command.

Thu Mar  2 08:40:33 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>
	
	* Moved files from src directory
