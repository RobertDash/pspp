	* automake.mk fail.c: Added a debug transformation which always fails.

Sat May  6 16:02:55 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Get rid of `char *c' member in union value, for cleanliness.

	* recode.c: (union recode_value) New union.
	(struct map_in) Change x, y types to union recode_value.
	(struct map_out) Change value type to union recode_value.
	(find_src_string) Wrap data_in() call so it uses a real `union
	value'.

Sat May  6 14:08:42 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* select-if.c (cmd_filter): Make FILTER without any further
	keywords turn off filtering, with a warning, for compatibility.
	Change errors from cascading failures to ordinary failures.  Check
	for command terminator.

Sat May  6 13:25:57 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, remove
	PROCESS IF, which was deprecated anyway and can be easily
	simulated with TEMPORARY followed by SELECT IF.

	* select-if.c (cmd_process_if): Removed.
	(global var process_if_expr) Removed, along with all references
	globally.

Tue Apr 25 13:23:25 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* select-if.c (cmd_process_if): Use SW instead of MW for warning
	associated with a syntax file command.
