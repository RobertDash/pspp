	* select-if.c (cmd_filter): Make FILTER without any further
	keywords turn off filtering, with a warning, for compatibility.
	Change errors from cascading failures to ordinary failures.  Check
	for command terminator.

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, remove
	PROCESS IF, which was deprecated anyway and can be easily
	simulated with TEMPORARY followed by SELECT IF.

	* select-if.c (cmd_process_if): Removed.
	(global var process_if_expr) Removed, along with all references
	globally.

	* select-if.c (cmd_process_if): Use SW instead of MW for warning
	associated with a syntax file command.
