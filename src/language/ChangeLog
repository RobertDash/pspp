	* command.def: Mark FILE TYPE, RECORD TYPE unimplemented.

Wed Apr 26 21:13:46 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	CLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS is unsafe as implemented.  It's a fair
	amount of work to implement it correctly, so make it
	unimplemented.
		
	* command.c: (cmd_clear_transformations) Removed.

	* command.def: Mark CLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS as unimplemented.

Wed Apr 26 13:06:42 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Work on readline completion.

	* command.c: (pspp_completion_function) Removed.
	(pspp_attempted_completion_function) New function.
	(command_generator) New function.

Wed Apr 26 13:04:48 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Improve the way we handle the various parsing "states".  Until now
	we've hard-coded the state transitions in the command definition
	file, but that's error-prone and, worse, it's redundant--we can
	figure out what state we're in anyhow.  We can cleanly handle
	INPUT PROGRAM and FILE TYPE with a nested command-processing loop.
	
	* command.c: (cmd_result_is_success) New function.
	(cmd_result_is_failure) New function.
	(enum states) New enum.
	(enum flags) New enum.
	(struct command) Add states, flags members.  Remove transition,
	skip_entire_name, debug members.  Renamed func member as function.
	(macro DEFCMD) Removed.
	(macro DBGCMD) Removed.
	(macro SPCCMD) Removed.
	(macro UNIMPL) Removed.
	(macro DEF_CMD) New.
	(macro UNIMPL_CMD) New.
	(macro COMMAND_CNT) Changed to static const var, renamed
	command_cnt.  Updated all references.
	(FILE_TYPE_okay) Removed.
	(cmd_parse) Rewrote in terms of do_parse_command().
	(do_parse_command) New function.
	(find_command) New function.
	(unknown_command_error) Use struct string to simplify code.
	(parse_command_name) Recognize comment command names.  Handle
	flags.  Don't reject testing-mode-only commands here--let higher
	level do it.
	(verify_valid_command) New function.
	(cmd_comment) New function.

	* command.def: Completely rewritten and now sensibly organized.

	* command.h: (enum STATE_*) Renamed CMD_STATE_*.
	(CMD_*) Now "enum cmd_result".  Added CMD_QUIT.  New
	CMD_END_SUBLOOP.  Removed CMD_TRAILING_GARBAGE, CMD_PART_SUCCESS,
	CMD_PART_SUCCESS_MAYBE and replaced all references by CMD_FAILURE.
	Added CMD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
        (macro DEFCMD) Removed.
	(macro DBGCMD) Removed.
	(macro SPCCMD) Removed.
	(macro UNIMPL) Removed.
	(macro DEF_CMD) New.
	(macro UNIMPL_CMD) New.

	* list.q: (write_all_headers) Adapt to new html and output
	internals.
	(clean_up) Ditto.
	(write_varname) Ditto.
	(write_fallback_headers) Ditto.
	(determine_layout) Ditto.
	(list_cases) Ditto.
