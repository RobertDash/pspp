	* command.def: Added additional unimpl commands.

Sun Oct 15 19:38:55 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* command.c: (do_parse_command) Issue an error for unimplemented
	commands, instead of silently ignoring them.  Reported by John
	Darrington.

Wed Jun 28 11:38:23 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Don't offer both the full and abbreviated names for a single
	command in command name completion.
	
	* command.c: (enum flags) Add F_ABBREV flag.
	(cmd_complete) Ignore command with F_ABBREV flag set.

	* command.def: Add F_ABBREV to N, Q, SORT commands.

Tue Jun 27 22:36:38 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Fix regression in command name completion reported by John
	Darrington.  Now completion is again state-dependent and occurs
	only on the first line of a command.
	
	* command.c (do_parse_command): Move reading the first token of
	the command here, from execute_command and cmd_input_program.
	Call set_completion_state and getl_set_prompt_style here.
	(do_parse_command) Use in_correct_state instead of
	verify_valid_command.
	(verify_valid_command) Break into two new functions,
	in_correct_state and report_state_mismatch.
	(set_completion_state) New function.
	(cmd_complete) New function.
	[HAVE_READLINE] (pspp_attempted_completion_function) Removed.
	[HAVE_READLINE] (command_generator) Removed.

	* line-buffer.c: (struct getl_source) Change `interactive' member
	signature to take enum getl_prompt_style instead of const char *.
	(create_interactive_source) Ditto, for parameter type.
	(getl_append_interactive) Ditto.
	(read_line_from_source) Pass get_prompt_style() to interactive
	function instead of get_prompt().
	(get_prompt) Removed.
	(get_prompt_style) New function.

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, remove
	PROCESS IF, which was deprecated anyway and can be easily
	simulated with TEMPORARY followed by SELECT IF.

	* command.def: Removed PROCESS IF.

Mon May  1 18:17:52 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Further clean up the CMD_* command result codes.
	
	* command.c (cmd_result_is_valid): New function.
	(cmd_result_is_success) Assert that argument is valid.  Simplified
	check to one for a positive result.
	(cmd_result_is_failure) Assert that argument is valid.  Simplified
	check to one for a negative result.
	(do_parse_command) Check that command's returned result is valid.

	* command.h: (enum cmd_result) Renamed CMD_QUIT to CMD_FINISH and
	updated all users.  Removed CMD_END_SUBLOOP in favor of new
	CMD_PRIVATE_FIRST...CMD_PRIVATE_LAST range.  Changed failure codes
	to have negative values.

Mon May  1 15:56:56 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Remove vestiges of FILE TYPE support. 
	
	* command.def: Mark FILE TYPE, RECORD TYPE unimplemented.

Wed Apr 26 21:13:46 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	CLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS is unsafe as implemented.  It's a fair
	amount of work to implement it correctly, so make it
	unimplemented.
		
	* command.c: (cmd_clear_transformations) Removed.

	* command.def: Mark CLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS as unimplemented.

Wed Apr 26 13:06:42 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Work on readline completion.

	* command.c: (pspp_completion_function) Removed.
	(pspp_attempted_completion_function) New function.
	(command_generator) New function.

Wed Apr 26 13:04:48 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Improve the way we handle the various parsing "states".  Until now
	we've hard-coded the state transitions in the command definition
	file, but that's error-prone and, worse, it's redundant--we can
	figure out what state we're in anyhow.  We can cleanly handle
	INPUT PROGRAM and FILE TYPE with a nested command-processing loop.
	
	* command.c: (cmd_result_is_success) New function.
	(cmd_result_is_failure) New function.
	(enum states) New enum.
	(enum flags) New enum.
	(struct command) Add states, flags members.  Remove transition,
	skip_entire_name, debug members.  Renamed func member as function.
	(macro DEFCMD) Removed.
	(macro DBGCMD) Removed.
	(macro SPCCMD) Removed.
	(macro UNIMPL) Removed.
	(macro DEF_CMD) New.
	(macro UNIMPL_CMD) New.
	(macro COMMAND_CNT) Changed to static const var, renamed
	command_cnt.  Updated all references.
	(FILE_TYPE_okay) Removed.
	(cmd_parse) Rewrote in terms of do_parse_command().
	(do_parse_command) New function.
	(find_command) New function.
	(unknown_command_error) Use struct string to simplify code.
	(parse_command_name) Recognize comment command names.  Handle
	flags.  Don't reject testing-mode-only commands here--let higher
	level do it.
	(verify_valid_command) New function.
	(cmd_comment) New function.

	* command.def: Completely rewritten and now sensibly organized.

	* command.h: (enum STATE_*) Renamed CMD_STATE_*.
	(CMD_*) Now "enum cmd_result".  Added CMD_QUIT.  New
	CMD_END_SUBLOOP.  Removed CMD_TRAILING_GARBAGE, CMD_PART_SUCCESS,
	CMD_PART_SUCCESS_MAYBE and replaced all references by CMD_FAILURE.
	Added CMD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
        (macro DEFCMD) Removed.
	(macro DBGCMD) Removed.
	(macro SPCCMD) Removed.
	(macro UNIMPL) Removed.
	(macro DEF_CMD) New.
	(macro UNIMPL_CMD) New.

Mon Apr  3 11:03:36 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* list.q: (write_all_headers) Adapt to new html and output
	internals.
	(clean_up) Ditto.
	(write_varname) Ditto.
	(write_fallback_headers) Ditto.
	(determine_layout) Ditto.
	(list_cases) Ditto.

	* Moved files from src directory
