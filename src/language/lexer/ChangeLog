Sun Nov 19 09:20:42 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* range-parser.c (parse_num_range): Because data_in takes an enum
	fmt_type now, not a struct fmt_spec, change the type of the
	corresponding argument.  Updated all callers.
	(parse_number) Ditto.

Sun Nov 12 06:34:06 WST 2006 John Darrrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* format-parser.c format-parser.h lexer.c lexer.h q2c.c range-parser.c
	  range-parser.h subcommand-list.c variable-parser.c
	  variable-parser.h:

	Encapsulated the lexer into an object, and updated everything
	accordingly.

Tue Oct 31 18:09:32 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* range-parser.c (parse_number): Fix error message.

Sat Oct 28 16:17:18 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* lexer.c lexer.h: Added a line_buffer (previously an external
	reference called getl_buf). 

Thu Oct 26 20:18:03 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* lexer.c (parse_string): Make lexing of binary, hex, and octal
	strings work (fixes bug #17948).  Allow null bytes in strings, now
	that there's a use for them (see tests/formats/float-format.sh).

Sun Jul 16 21:03:34 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* format-parser.h: New file.  Moved prototypes of format-parser.c
	functions here, from lexer.h.

	* format-parser.c: (parse_format_specifier_name) Rewrote and
	changed semantics.
	(parse_abstract_format_specifier) New function.
	(parse_format_specifier) Rewrote in terms of
	parse_abstract_format_specifier.  Removed "options" parameter, so
	callers had to be updated.  Callers that didn't want messages
	emitted were changed to use the new msg_disable/msg_enable
	functions.

	* variables-parser.c: (parse_variables_pool) New function.
	(register_vars_pool) New function.
	(parse_DATA_LIST_vars_pool) New function.
	(parse_mixed_vars_pool) Use register_vars_pool.  Assert that
	PV_APPEND is not in the options.
	
Sat Jul  1 17:40:38 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Fix bug #11612, "q2c documentation does not agree with code".
	
	* q2c.c (parse_subcommand): Make "+" mean ARITY_MANY, absence
	mean ARITY_ONCE_ONLY.

Tue Jul  4 09:45:12 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Fix bug #15766 (/KEEP subcommand on SAVE doesn't fully support
	ALL) and additional underlying system file issues.
	
	* variable-parser.c (add_variable): Move test earlier for clarity
	and efficiency.
	(parse_var_set_vars) Accept ALL within a variable list, not just
	at the beginning of one.

Tue Jun 27 22:54:30 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* automake.mk (src_language_lexer_liblexer_a_SOURCES): Add
	variable-parser.h.

Tue Jun 27 19:15:33 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Add auxiliary data pointer to q2c parse_<command> function, and
	pass it along to the custom parser functions.

	Updated all uses of custom functions in all the existing .q files.
	
	* q2c.c (dump_declarations): Include auxiliary parameter in
	function prototypes.
	(dump_subcommand) Include aux arg in calls to custom functions.
	(dump_parser) Include aux param in parse_<command> function
	definition.  Include aux arg in calls to custom functions.

Tue Jun 27 12:07:34 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* variable-parser.h: New header.  Moved the var_set and variable
	parsing declarations here.

	* q2c.c (main): Emit include for new variable-parser.h header.

Sun Jun 25 22:41:00 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* q2c.c (dump_free): For SBC_DBL_LIST, enclose the output code in
	curly braces, because it contains a variable declaration and might
	not be at the beginning of a block.

Fri Jun  9 14:02:19 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Reform string library.
	
	* q2c.c (dump_subcommand): ds_c_str() became ds_cstr(), in
	generated code.

Wed Apr 26 13:30:41 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* lexer.c: (lex_discard_rest_of_command) New function.

Mon Apr 24 14:12:08 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* q2c.c: Use exit.h from gnulib instead of checking for and
	defining EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE by hand.

Sat Apr 15 14:30:35 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* q2c.c: Change DEBUGGING macro to DUMP_TOKENS for clarity and to
	avoid dumping all the tokens to stdout when --enable-debug is
	passed to configure.

Fri Mar 10 08:29:25 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* q2c.c: (dump_free) Free proper member for var list, instead of
	hard-coding to v_variables.  Thanks to Jason Stover for reporting
	this bug.

Thu Mar  2 08:40:33 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>
	
	* Moved files from src directory
