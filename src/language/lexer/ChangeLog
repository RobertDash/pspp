	* q2c.c (dump_free): For SBC_DBL_LIST, enclose the output code in
	curly braces, because it contains a variable declaration and might
	not be at the beginning of a block.

	Reform string library.

	* q2c.c: Change DEBUGGING macro to DUMP_TOKENS for clarity and to
	avoid dumping all the tokens to stdout when --enable-debug is
	passed to configure.

	* q2c.c: (dump_free) Free proper member for var list, instead of

	this bug.
