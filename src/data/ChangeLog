	avoid dependence on the order of the FMT_* enums.

Tue Oct 31 19:35:36 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* data-out.c: (num_to_string) Removed, because it was dead code.

	decimals, even if the format type does not.  This way, we can
	accurately reproduce incorrect formats in user output.

Tue Jul  4 08:47:35 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Fix bug #15766 (/KEEP subcommand on SAVE doesn't fully support
	ALL) and additional underlying system file issues.

	Thanks to John Darrington for review.

	First problem: var_hash points to variables not owned by the
	sys-file-reader, which the caller may free or modify.  Use an
	array of sfm_vars instead, as done earlier (e.g. CVS version
	1.12).
	
	* sys-file-reader.c (struct sfm_reader): Remove var_hash, svars
	members and remove all code that references it.  Add vars, var_cnt
	members.  Remove fix_specials member, which was unused.
	(struct sfm_var) Remove name member, which was unused.
	(sfm_close_reader) Free vars member instead of var_hash.
	(compare_var_shortnames) Removed.
	(hash_var_shortname) Removed.
	(sfm_open_reader) Fill out vars array.
	(compare_var_index) Removed.
	(sfm_read_case) Use vars instead of var_hash.
	
	Second problem: we're confused about when we actually have very
	long strings, causing us to choose incorrectly between slow path
	and fast path in sfm_read_case.

	* sys-file-reader.c: (sfm_open_reader) Only mark has_vls if we
	have very long strings, not when we have long variable names,
	which is an unrelated feature.

Tue Jun 27 12:06:49 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* variable.h: Move var_set and variable parsing declarations to
	new header, src/language/lexer/variable-parser.h.  Modified lots
	of files to include the new header.

Sun Jun 25 22:39:32 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* value-labels.c (value_to_string): When there's no value label,
	format the variable according to its print format, instead of
	always effectively using A or F format.

Mon Jun 19 18:05:42 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* casefile.c (casefile_get_random_reader): Nasty hack to get around

Sat May  6 12:38:55 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, remove
	PROCESS IF, which was deprecated anyway and can be easily
	simulated with TEMPORARY followed by SELECT IF.

	* procedure.c: (open_active_file) Don't call
	add_process_if_trns().
	(discard_variables) Get rid of redundant call to
	proc_cancel_all_transformations().

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, get rid of
	the output code for SPLIT FILE groups in procedure.c, which really
	shouldn't be doing any output.  Move it into the individual
	procedures instead.  This also adds some flexibility.

	Updated many users of procedure_with_splits() and
	multipass_procedure_with_splits() to call
	output_split_file_values() and to deal with increased use of
	const.

	* procedure.c: (struct split_aux_data) Add "const struct ccase *"
	parameter to begin_func member.
	(procedure_with_splits) Add "const struct ccase *" parameter to

Fri May  5 22:48:50 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  Change
	internal_procedure() so that it calls open_active_file() and
	close_active_file(), which isolates most of the actual procedure
	functionality.

	* procedure.c: (struct write_case_data) Rename `proc_func' member
	to `case_func' and update all references.
	(procedure) Rewrite as one-line wrapper around
	internal_procedure().

	* data-out.c, data-in.c, variable.c, variable.h: New functions 
	copy_mangle and copy_demangle for reading/writing cases; emulates the 
	way SPSS deals with strings > 255 bytes.

        instead of literal values. Also fixed some constness issues.

	* format.h: Constness

	* sfm-private.h: Renamed the case_size identifier, since I discovered 
        that SPSS's respect for this variable is very nominal.

Mon May  1 15:45:42 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Change case limit type from int to size_t.

	* dictionary.c: (struct dictionary) Change type of case_limit

Wed Apr 26 14:55:19 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* variable.h: (struct variable) Remove `init' member and all
	references to it from other files.  It was initialized in several
	places, but nothing really ever used it for anything worthwhile.
	Thanks to Jason Stover for pointing out how confusing this
	member is.

Sun Apr 23 22:04:45 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Format message ourselves.

	* data-in.c: (vdls_error) Ditto.

Sun Apr 16 18:49:51 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	GNU standards require "file name" instead of "filename" in
	documentation.  It's nice for our code to follow the convention
	too.
	
	* casefile.c: (struct casefile) Rename `filename' member to
	`file_name'.  Updated all references.

	* file-name.c: [!unix] (struct file_identity) Rename
	normalized_filename member to normalized_file_name.  Updated all
	references.

Sun Apr 16 18:35:33 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	We don't really support anything but Unix-like environments well,
	so we might as well de-obfuscate by writing directory and path
	separators explicitly.

	* file-name.h: (macro DIR_SEPARATOR) Removed.  Changed all usages
	to just '/'.
	(macro PATH_SEPARATOR) Removed.  Changed all usages to just ':'.
	(macro DIR_SEPARATOR_STRING) Removed.  Changed all usages to just
	"/".
	(macro PATH_SEPARATOR_STRING) Removed.  Changed all usages to just
	":"

Sun Apr 16 18:28:35 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

Sun Apr 16 16:33:58 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* filename.c: (fn_tilde_expand) Rewrite for cleaner code.  
	Also, now it only tilde-expands file names, not paths.
	(fn_search_path) Tilde-expand one directory at a time.

Sun Apr 16 16:28:06 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* filename.c: (fn_search_path) rewrite for cleaner code.  Also,

	(macro PATH_SEPARATOR_STRING) New.
Sun Apr 16 16:05:28 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	rid of VM() and the other msg() support for "verbosity", replacing
	it by a new function verbose_msg().

	* filename.c: (fn_search_path) Use verbose_msg() instead of
	msg(VM(), ...).  

Sat Apr 15 19:53:19 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Get rid of our own int32 type in favor of the standard int32_t
	type.

	include <stdint.h>.

	* sys-file-reader.c: Use int32_t instead of int32 throughout.
	
	* sys-file-writer.c: Use int32_t instead of int32 throughout.

	* variable.c (var_is_valid_name): Move declarations before code
	for C90 compliance.

	* filename.ch (fn_interp_vars): Fixed small buglet.

Tue Mar 28 13:47:16 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>
	
	* filename.[ch] (fn_interp_vars): Changed the signature and semantics
	so as to modify the string inline.   Thus makeing it easier to
	destroy the results when no longer needed.
