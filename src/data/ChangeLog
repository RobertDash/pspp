	GNU standards require "file name" instead of "filename" in
	documentation.  It's nice for our code to follow the convention
	too.
	
	* casefile.c: (struct casefile) Rename `filename' member to
	`file_name'.  Updated all references.

	* file-name.c: [!unix] (struct file_identity) Rename
	normalized_filename member to normalized_file_name.  Updated all
	references.

	We don't really support anything but Unix-like environments well,
	so we might as well de-obfuscate by writing directory and path
	separators explicitly.

	* file-name.h: (macro DIR_SEPARATOR) Removed.  Changed all usages
	to just '/'.
	(macro PATH_SEPARATOR) Removed.  Changed all usages to just ':'.
	(macro DIR_SEPARATOR_STRING) Removed.  Changed all usages to just
	"/".
	(macro PATH_SEPARATOR_STRING) Removed.  Changed all usages to just
	":"

	GNU standards require "file name" instead of "filename" in
	documentation.  It's nice for our code to follow the convention
	too.
	
	* filename.c: Rename to file-name.c.

	* filename.h: Rename to file-name.h.  Update all inclusions.
	Update header guards.

	* automake.mk: Update file names.

Sun Apr 16 16:42:47 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* filename.c: (fn_dirname) Renamed fn_dir_name(), all references
	updated.
	(fn_basename) Removed (dead code).
	(fn_absolute_p) Renamed fn_is_absolute(), all references updated.
	(fn_special_p) Renamed fn_is_special(), all references updated.
	(fn_exists_p) Renamed fn_exists(), all references updated.

Sun Apr 16 16:33:58 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* filename.c: (fn_tilde_expand) Rewrite for cleaner code.  
	Also, now it only tilde-expands file names, not paths.
	(fn_search_path) Tilde-expand one directory at a time.

Sun Apr 16 16:28:06 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* filename.c: (fn_search_path) rewrite for cleaner code.  Also,
	get rid of non-Unixlike version of the code, which has probably
	never been tested.
	(fn_prepend_dir) Removed (dead code).

	* filename.h: (macro DIR_SEPARATOR_STRING) New.
	(macro PATH_SEPARATOR_STRING) New.
Sun Apr 16 16:05:28 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Continue reforming error message support.  In this phase, we get
	rid of VM() and the other msg() support for "verbosity", replacing
	it by a new function verbose_msg().

	* filename.c: (fn_search_path) Use verbose_msg() instead of
	msg(VM(), ...).  

Sat Apr 15 19:53:19 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* sfm-private.h: Get rid of #defines after #error, which makes no
	sense.

Sat Apr 15 19:48:57 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Get rid of our own int32 type in favor of the standard int32_t
	type.
	
	* sfm-private.h: (int32 macro) Don't define this anymore.  Do
	include <stdint.h>.

	* sys-file-reader.c: Use int32_t instead of int32 throughout.
	
	* sys-file-writer.c: Use int32_t instead of int32 throughout.

Sat Apr 15 19:36:47 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Remove ill-considered file routines that are no longer used.
	
	* filename.c: (fn_open_ext) Removed.
	(fn_close_ext) Removed.

	* filename.h: (struct file_ext) Removed.

Mon Apr  3 13:22:39 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* variable.c (var_is_valid_name): Move declarations before code
	for C90 compliance.

Tue Apr  4 15:28:40 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* filename.ch (fn_interp_vars): Fixed small buglet.

Tue Mar 28 13:47:16 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>
	
	* filename.[ch] (fn_interp_vars): Changed the signature and semantics
	so as to modify the string inline.   Thus makeing it easier to
	destroy the results when no longer needed.
	
2006-03-25  Jason Stover  <jhs@math.gcsu.edu>

	* category.c (cat_stored_values_destroy): Fixed memory leak.

Fri Mar 24 18:15:41 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Add some missing frees.  Thanks to John Darrington for reporting
	these.

	* any-writer.c (any_writer_close): Free writer.

	* any-reader.c (any_reader_close): Free reader.

Mon Mar 20 16:33:53 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* por-file-reader.c: (error) Mark as NO_RETURN.

Sat Mar 11 15:06:07 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* settings.c: Changed default value of scompress to true.

Sat Mar  4 13:22:51 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* sfm-private.h: Include variable.h, to get SHORT_NAME_LEN.

	* value.h: Remove check on MAX_SHORT_STRING, which I don't think
	really applies.

	* variable.h: Move definition of SHORT_NAME_LEN, LONG_NAME_LEN
	here from pref.h.orig.

Sat Mar  4 12:50:48 WST 2006 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* sys-file-reader.c: Fixed bug reading compressed files.
