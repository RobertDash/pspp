	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, get rid of
	many global variables, consolidating procedure execution in
	procedure.c.  Encapsulate transformations in new "struct
	trns_chain".  Also, change implementation of N OF CASES, FILTER,
	and PROCESS IF from special cases to transformations.
	 
	* sort.c: (prepare_to_sort_active_file) Don't run a procedure
	here.
	(sort_active_file_in_place) Rewrite to run a procedure, capture
	the output, sort the output, and set that as the source for the
	next procedure.
	(struct sort_to_casefile_cb_data) New structure.
	(sort_to_casefile_callback) New function.
	(sort_active_file_to_casefile) Rewrite to use
	multipass_procedure().
