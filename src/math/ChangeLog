	* coefficient.c (pspp_coeff_init): Make design_matrix arg const.

2006-07-14  Jason Stover  <jhs@math.gcsu.edu>

	* coefficient.c (pspp_coeff_init): Removed use of
	pspp_linreg_cache to make the routines more generally useful.

2006-05-19  Jason Stover  <jhs@math.gcsu.edu>

	* coefficient.h: Renamed pspp_linreg_coeff to pspp_coeff.

	* coefficient.c: Moved to src/math.

	* coefficient.h: Moved to src/math.

Tue May  9 21:09:37 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* sort.c (sort_active_file_to_casefile): Check return value of
	multipass_procedure().

Wed May  3 23:06:43 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	Continue reforming procedure execution.  In this phase, get rid of
	many global variables, consolidating procedure execution in
	procedure.c.  Encapsulate transformations in new "struct
	trns_chain".  Also, change implementation of N OF CASES, FILTER,
	and PROCESS IF from special cases to transformations.
	 
	* sort.c: (prepare_to_sort_active_file) Don't run a procedure
	here.
	(sort_active_file_in_place) Rewrite to run a procedure, capture
	the output, sort the output, and set that as the source for the
	next procedure.
	(struct sort_to_casefile_cb_data) New structure.
	(sort_to_casefile_callback) New function.
	(sort_active_file_to_casefile) Rewrite to use
	multipass_procedure().

	* removed unused variable.

Sat Apr 15 18:01:22 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* factor-stats.c (metrics_postcalc): Add casts to fix warnings.

	* Moved files from src directory
