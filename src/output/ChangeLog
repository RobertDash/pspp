	* table.c (tab_natural_width): Get rid of warning on empty column,
	which tended to just trigger false positives because we handle
	joined cells so badly.  We need a real fix, and the warning is not
	helpful.

	* table.c (tab_offset): [DEBUGGING] Let row, col arguments be as
	big as row or column count.

	the bug.

Sun Apr 16 11:48:25 2006  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>
