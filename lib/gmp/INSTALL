Known Build Problems
--------------------

Note that GCC 2.7.2 (as well as 2.6.3) for the RS/6000 and PowerPC can not
be used to compile GMP, due to a bug in GCC.  If you want to use GCC, you
need to apply the patch at the end of this file, or use a later version of
the compiler.

If you are on a Sequent Symmetry, use GAS instead of the system's assembler
due to the latter's serious bugs.

The system compiler on NeXT is a massacred and old gcc, even if the
compiler calls itself cc.  This compiler cannot be used to build GMP.  You
need to get a real gcc, and install that before you compile GMP.  (NeXT
might have fixed this in newer releases of their system.)

Please report other problems to bug-gmp@prep.ai.mit.edu.
