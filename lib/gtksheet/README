This is not part of the GNU PSPP program, but is used with GNU PSPP.

This directory contains a version of the GtkSheet widget from the gtk-extra 
project at http://gtkextra.sourceforge.net  The version found here has 
major modifications developed for the needs of PSPP.  Every effort has been
made to keep GtkSheet application independent. Thus, it should be possible
to use this modified software for other applications.  However, the API is
substantially different from the original.
