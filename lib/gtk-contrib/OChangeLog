	Patch #6506.  Reviewed by John Darrington.

	* gtksheet.c (gtk_sheet_unrealize): Don't call gtk_widget_unparent
	on sheet->button if it's null.

2008-05-06  Ben Pfaff  <blp@gnu.org>

	* gtksheet.c (gtk_sheet_dispose): Set the sheet's entry_container
	and button members to NULL after unref'ing them, so that a later
	call to gtk_sheet_for_all will not try to dereference a dangling
	pointer.

	* gsheet-row-iface.c gsheet-row-iface.h: Delete unused, unneccesary
	gpointer variable from the interface.

	* gtksheet.c: Update to match new gsheet-row-iface

	* gtksheet.c gtksheet.h: Corrected some leaks and other problems
	related to de-allocating the sheet.

	* gtksheet.c: Removed the sheet_locked feature, which we never
	used, and interfered with the editability of the entry widget.

	* gtksheet.c: Add one to the row to which we scroll. Seems like
	the best way to cope with granularity problems.

	* gtksheet.c (range_update_callback): Scroll to cell 0,0 if the

24 July 2007 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* gtksheet.c gtksheet.h: Removed the `clip' feature, which IMO 
	is a croc, and we're unlikely to use.  In its place, added a primary 
	selection which supports text and html targets.

16 July 2007 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* gtksheet.c gtksheet.h: Removed some legacy functions called from

        function call.  Removed hadjustment_changed and vadjustment_changed

03 July 2007 John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

	* gtksheet.c gtksheet.h: Removed the autoscroll-on-select feature 
	that was causing us grief.

    * gtksheet.c: Removed call to gtk_entry_set_text, which caused warnings

Sat Jan 28 08:48:08 2006 UTC John Darrington <john@darrington.wattle.id.au>

    * Separated the data out of the GtkSheet.  The gtksheet should now be
    regarded as a way of looking into the data.  The data is represented by a
    GSheetModel and the rows and columns by  GSheetRow and GSheetColumn.
