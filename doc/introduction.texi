@cindex PSPP language
@cindex language, PSPP
PSPP is a tool for statistical analysis of sampled data.  It reads a
syntax file and a data file, analyzes the data, and writes the results
to a listing file or to standard output.

The language accepted by PSPP is similar to those accepted by SPSS
statistical products.  The details of PSPP's language are given
later in this manual.

PSPP produces tables and charts as output, which it can produce in
several formats; currently, ASCII, PostScript, PDF, HTML, and SVG are
supported.

The current version of PSPP, @value{VERSION}, is woefully incomplete in
terms of its statistical procedure support.  PSPP is a work in progress.
The author hopes to fully support all features in the products
that PSPP replaces, eventually.  The author welcomes questions,
comments, donations, and code submissions.  @xref{Bugs,,Submitting Bug
Reports}, for instructions on contacting the author.
