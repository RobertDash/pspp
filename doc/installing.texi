PSPP is written in ISO C and primarily targeted at UNIX-like
environments.  To install PSPP under a UNIX-like operating system,
follow the steps below.

@enumerate
@item
@code{cd} to the directory containing the PSPP source.

@cindex configure, GNU
@cindex GNU configure
@item
Type @samp{./configure} to configure for your particular operating
system and compiler.  Running @code{configure} takes a while.  While
running, it displays some messages telling which features it is checking
for.

You can optionally supply some options to @code{configure} to
give it hints about how to do its job.  Type @code{./configure --help}
to see a list of options.

@cindex compiling
@item
Type @samp{make} to compile the package.  If there are any errors during
compilation, try to fix them.  If modifications are necessary to compile
correctly under your configuration, contact the author.
@xref{Bugs,,Submitting Bug Reports}, for details.

@cindex self-tests, running
@item
Type @samp{make check} to run self-tests on the compiled PSPP package.

@cindex installation
@cindex PSPP, installing
@cindex @file{/usr/local/share/pspp/}
@cindex @file{/usr/local/bin/}
@cindex @file{/usr/local/info/}
@cindex documentation, installing
@item
Become the superuser and type @samp{make install} to install the
PSPP binaries, by default in @file{/usr/local/bin/}.  The
directory @file{/usr/local/share/pspp/} is created and populated with
files needed by PSPP at runtime.  This step will also cause the
PSPP documentation to be installed in @file{/usr/local/info/},
but only if that directory already exists.

@item
(optional) Type @samp{make clean} to delete the PSPP binaries
from the source tree.
