PSPP is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of this program that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of PSPP, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change these programs or use pieces of
them in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of PSPP, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for PSPP.  If these programs are
modified by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to
know that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.

The precise conditions of the licenses for PSPP are found in the
General Public Licenses that accompany them.  This manual specifically
is covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (@pxref{GNU Free
Documentation License}).
