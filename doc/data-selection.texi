@node FILTER
@section FILTER
@vindex FILTER

@display
FILTER BY var_name.
FILTER OFF.
@end display

@cmd{FILTER} allows a boolean-valued variable to be used to select
cases from the data stream for processing.

To set up filtering, specify BY and a variable name.  Keyword
BY is optional but recommended.  Cases which have a zero or system- or
user-missing value are excluded from analysis, but not deleted from the
data stream.  Cases with other values are analyzed.
To filter based on a different condition, use
transformations such as @cmd{COMPUTE} or @cmd{RECODE} to compute a
filter variable of the required form, then specify that variable on
@cmd{FILTER}.

@code{FILTER OFF} turns off case filtering.

Filtering takes place immediately before cases pass to a procedure for
analysis.  Only one filter variable may be active at a time.  Normally,
case filtering continues until it is explicitly turned off with @code{FILTER
OFF}.  However, if @cmd{FILTER} is placed after TEMPORARY, it filters only
the next procedure or procedure-like command.

@node N OF CASES
@section N OF CASES
@vindex N OF CASES

@display
N [OF CASES] num_of_cases [ESTIMATED].
@end display

@cmd{N OF CASES} limits the number of cases processed by any
procedures that follow it in the command stream.  @code{N OF CASES
100}, for example, tells PSPP to disregard all cases after the first
100.

When @cmd{N OF CASES} is specified after @cmd{TEMPORARY}, it affects
only the next procedure (@pxref{TEMPORARY}).  Otherwise, cases beyond
the limit specified are not processed by any later procedure.

If the limit specified on @cmd{N OF CASES} is greater than the number
of cases in the active file, it has no effect.

When @cmd{N OF CASES} is used along with @cmd{SAMPLE} or @cmd{SELECT
IF}, the case limit is applied to the cases obtained after sampling or
case selection, regardless of how @cmd{N OF CASES} is placed relative
to @cmd{SAMPLE} or @cmd{SELECT IF} in the command file.  Thus, the
commands @code{N OF CASES 100} and @code{SAMPLE .5} will both randomly
sample approximately half of the active file's cases, then select the
first 100 of those sampled, regardless of their order in the command
file.

@cmd{N OF CASES} with the @code{ESTIMATED} keyword gives an estimated
number of cases before @cmd{DATA LIST} or another command to read in
data.  @code{ESTIMATED} never limits the number of cases processed by
procedures.  PSPP currently does not make use of case count estimates.

@node SAMPLE
@section SAMPLE
@vindex SAMPLE

@display
SAMPLE num1 [FROM num2].
@end display

@cmd{SAMPLE} randomly samples a proportion of the cases in the active
file.  Unless it follows @cmd{TEMPORARY}, it operates as a
transformation, permanently removing cases from the active file.

The proportion to sample can be expressed as a single number between 0
and 1.  If @code{k} is the number specified, and @code{N} is the number
of currently-selected cases in the active file, then after
@code{SAMPLE @var{k}.}, approximately @code{k*N} cases will be
selected.

The proportion to sample can also be specified in the style @code{SAMPLE
@var{m} FROM @var{N}}.  With this style, cases are selected as follows:

@enumerate
@item
If @var{N} is equal to the number of currently-selected cases in the
active file, exactly @var{m} cases will be selected.

@item
If @var{N} is greater than the number of currently-selected cases in the
active file, an equivalent proportion of cases will be selected.

@item
If @var{N} is less than the number of currently-selected cases in the
active, exactly @var{m} cases will be selected @emph{from the first
@var{N} cases in the active file.}
@end enumerate

@cmd{SAMPLE} and @cmd{SELECT IF} are performed in
the order specified by the syntax file.

@cmd{SAMPLE} is always performed before @code{N OF CASES}, regardless
of ordering in the syntax file (@pxref{N OF CASES}).

The same values for @cmd{SAMPLE} may result in different samples.  To
obtain the same sample, use the @code{SET} command to set the random
number seed to the same value before each @cmd{SAMPLE}.  Different
samples may still result when the file is processed on systems with
differing endianness or floating-point formats.  By default, the
random number seed is based on the system time.

@node SELECT IF
@section SELECT IF
@vindex SELECT IF

@display
SELECT IF expression.
@end display

@cmd{SELECT IF} selects cases for analysis based on the value of a
boolean expression.  Cases not selected are permanently eliminated
from the active file, unless @cmd{TEMPORARY} is in effect
(@pxref{TEMPORARY}).

Specify a boolean expression (@pxref{Expressions}).  If the value of the
expression is true for a particular case, the case will be analyzed.  If
the expression has a false or missing value, then the case will be
deleted from the data stream.

Place @cmd{SELECT IF} as early in the command file as
possible.  Cases that are deleted early can be processed more
efficiently in time and space.

When @cmd{SELECT IF} is specified following @cmd{TEMPORARY}
(@pxref{TEMPORARY}), the @cmd{LAG} function may not be used
(@pxref{LAG}).

@node SPLIT FILE
@section SPLIT FILE
@vindex SPLIT FILE

@display
SPLIT FILE [@{LAYERED, SEPARATE@}] BY var_list.
SPLIT FILE OFF.
@end display

@cmd{SPLIT FILE} allows multiple sets of data present in one data
file to be analyzed separately using single statistical procedure
commands.

Specify a list of variable names to analyze multiple sets of
data separately.  Groups of adjacent cases having the same values for these
variables are analyzed by statistical procedure commands as one group.
An independent analysis is carried out for each group of cases, and the
variable values for the group are printed along with the analysis.

When a list of variable names is specified, one of the keywords
LAYERED or SEPARATE may also be specified.  If provided, either
keyword are ignored.

Groups are formed only by @emph{adjacent} cases.  To create a split 
using a variable where like values are not adjacent in the working file,
you should first sort the data by that variable (@pxref{SORT CASES}).

Specify OFF to disable @cmd{SPLIT FILE} and resume analysis of the
entire active file as a single group of data.

When @cmd{SPLIT FILE} is specified after @cmd{TEMPORARY}, it affects only
the next procedure (@pxref{TEMPORARY}).

@node TEMPORARY
@section TEMPORARY
@vindex TEMPORARY

@display
TEMPORARY.
@end display

@cmd{TEMPORARY} is used to make the effects of transformations
following its execution temporary.  These transformations will
affect only the execution of the next procedure or procedure-like
command.  Their effects will not be saved to the active file.

The only specification on @cmd{TEMPORARY} is the command name.

@cmd{TEMPORARY} may not appear within a @cmd{DO IF} or @cmd{LOOP}
construct.  It may appear only once between procedures and
procedure-like commands.

Scratch variables cannot be used following @cmd{TEMPORARY}.

An example may help to clarify:

@example
DATA LIST /X 1-2.
BEGIN DATA.
 2
 4
10
15
20
24
END DATA.
COMPUTE X=X/2.
TEMPORARY.
COMPUTE X=X+3.
DESCRIPTIVES X.
DESCRIPTIVES X.
@end example

The data read by the first @cmd{DESCRIPTIVES} are 4, 5, 8,
10.5, 13, 15.  The data read by the first @cmd{DESCRIPTIVES} are 1, 2,
5, 7.5, 10, 12.

@node WEIGHT
@section WEIGHT
@vindex WEIGHT

@display
WEIGHT BY var_name.
WEIGHT OFF.
@end display

@cmd{WEIGHT} assigns cases varying weights,
changing the frequency distribution of the active file.  Execution of
@cmd{WEIGHT} is delayed until data have been read.

If a variable name is specified, @cmd{WEIGHT} causes the values of that
variable to be used as weighting factors for subsequent statistical
procedures.  Use of keyword BY is optional but recommended.  Weighting
variables must be numeric.  Scratch variables may not be used for
weighting (@pxref{Scratch Variables}).

When OFF is specified, subsequent statistical procedures will weight all
cases equally.

A positive integer weighting factor @var{w} on a case will yield the
same statistical output as would replicating the case @var{w} times.
A weighting factor of 0 is treated for statistical purposes as if the
case did not exist in the input.  Weighting values need not be
integers, but negative and system-missing values for the weighting
variable are interpreted as weighting factors of 0.  User-missing
values are not treated specially.

When @cmd{WEIGHT} is specified after @cmd{TEMPORARY}, it affects only
the next procedure (@pxref{TEMPORARY}).

@cmd{WEIGHT} does not cause cases in the active file to be replicated in
memory.
