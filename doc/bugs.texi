@section Known bugs

This is the list of known bugs in PSPP.  In addition, @xref{Not
Implemented}, and @xref{Functions Not Implemented}, for lists of bugs
due to features not implemented.  For known bugs in individual language
features, see the documentation for that feature.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Nothing has yet been tested exhaustively. Be cautious using PSPP to
make important decisions.

@item
@code{make check} fails on some systems that don't like the syntax.  I'm
not sure why.  If someone could make an attempt to track this down, it
would be appreciated.

@item
PostScript driver bugs:

@itemize @minus
@item
Does not support driver arguments `max-fonts-simult' or
`optimize-text-size'.

@item
Minor problems with font-encodings.

@item
Fails to align fonts along their baselines.

@item
Does not support certain bizarre line intersections--should
never crop up in practice.

@item
Does not gracefully substitute for existing fonts whose
encodings are missing.

@item
Does not perform italic correction or left italic correction
on font changes.

@item
Encapsulated PostScript is unimplemented.
