Please send PSPP bug reports to bug-gnu-pspp@gnu.org.

Changes since 0.4.3:

  The PSPP license is now version 3 or later of the GNU General Public
  License.  Previously, it was version 2 or later.

  Changes in build dependencies:

    * iconv, which is ordinarily installed as part of a Unix-like
      system, is now required.  If you don't have it already, you can
      install GNU libiconv (http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/).

  The PROCESS IF command, which was deprecated, has been removed.  You
  may replace any usage of it by SELECT IF following TEMPORARY, which
  has the same effect.

  The default paper size for the PostScript driver is now determined
  using the PAPERSIZE environment variable, or the LC_PAPER locale
  category on systems that support it.  If these are not set, the
  default is now A4, instead of US letter.  To make US letter the
  default, set PAPERSIZE to "letter" in your environment.

  For developers, the build system now requires Autoconf 2.60 and
  Automake 1.10.

Changes since 0.4.0 to 0.4.1:

  Added support for very long string variables (over 255 bytes long).

  Output changes:

    * Output configuration options have changed.  Please refer to the
      manual for a full description of the available options.

      In consequence, you will need to reinstall your "devices" file.
      "make install" will do this for you.

    * The PostScript driver now obtains font metrics from AFM files,
      instead of Groff-format metrics files.  It can now embed
      PostScript fonts in its output.

      In consequence, you will need to install an AFM file for each
      font used in PostScript output.  "make install" will install AFM
      files for the standard PostScript files, including the ones that
      the PostScript driver uses by default.

  Newly implemented commands and statistical features:

    * CLOSE FILE HANDLE (a PSPP extension; see below).

    * REGRESSION.

    * XEXPORT (a PSPP extension).

  New PSPP extension:

    A new PSPP extension called "scratch files" has been implemented.
    A scratch file, like a system file, consists of a dictionary and
    any number of cases.  Small scratch files are stored in memory;
    one that grows too large is written to disk.  By default, any file
    handle whose name begins with # is assumed to refer to a scratch
    file.

    Scratch files can be used just about anywhere a system or portable
    file can be used.  Also, portable files are now allowed in most
    places that system files were allowed in previous PSPP version.

    A new CLOSE FILE HANDLE command allows the storage associated with
    scratch files to be freed.  It also allows file handles to be
    reassigned to new files.

    For more information on scratch files, refer to the "File Handles"
    section in the PSPP manual.  For specifics of what commands now
    allow what kinds of files to be specified, refer to the
    documentation on those particular commands.

  PSPP is now able to start up and run even if it cannot find its
  configuration files.

Changes from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0:

  Changes in build dependencies:

    * The GNU Scientific Library (libgsl), version 1.6 or later, is
      now required.

    * libplot from GNU plotutils is optional.  Without it, the new
      graphing features will not work.  If you do not have it
      installed, you must run `configure' with --without-libplot.

    * libgmp2 is no longer a dependency.

  Newly implemented commands and statistical features:

    * EXAMINE, including its graphing features.

    * FREQUENCIES now supports percentiles.

    * ONEWAY.

    * PERMISSIONS.

    * SHOW.

    * SORT CASES now sorts stably, that is, two cases with equal sort
      criteria will be in the same relative order before and after the
      sort.

    * T-TEST (re-written).

    * DATE and USE.  These commands are parsed but otherwise ignored,
      to enhance compatibility with certain command files that invoke
      them unnecessarily.

    * VARIABLE WIDTH, VARIABLE ALIGNMENT, and VARIABLE LEVEL.  These
      currently have no effect on PSPP output, but their values are
      written to and read from system files and thus may affect
      third-party software.

    * SET EPOCH implemented.

    * DATA LIST FREE and DATA LIST LIST now support arbitrary field
      delimiters.

    * FILE HANDLE now supports custom tab widths.

  Long variable names (and other identifiers) are now supported.  Up
  to the first 64 bytes of each identifier is significant.  PSPP now
  reads and writes system files compatible with SPSS version 12.

  New --algorithm and --syntax command line options allow
  SPSS-compatible or enhanced modes to be selected.

  Support for transformation expressions has been rewritten and
  significantly improved.  Refer to the manual for details.

  Calculation of moments (mean, standard deviation, kurtosis,
  skewness) has been rewritten and should now be more accurate.  In
  --algorithm=enhanced mode moments may be more accurate than SPSS in
  some cases.

  Numerous bugs have been fixed, too many to mention here.  Many new
  tests have been added, leading to the discovery and fixing of many
  of these bugs.

  The ASCII output driver can now squeeze multiple blank lines into
  single blank lines.

  Much of the code has been rewritten and refactored.  It is now much
  cleaner.

  The FILE TYPE and REPEATING DATA commands have been disabled for
  this release because their implementations were deemed too buggy to
  be useful.  They will be fixed and replaced in a future release.

  New pspp-mode for Emacs (in pspp-mode.el).

  Added rudimentary command-line completion for interactive input.

  lib/julcal and lib/dcdflib are no longer used, so they have been
  removed.

  For developers, the build system now requires Autoconf 2.58 and
  Automake 1.7.  The included gettext has been updated to version
  0.12.1.

  Some reports state that Texinfo 4.8, the latest version, may be
  necessary to successfully format the documentation on some systems.

Version 0.3.0 changes since 0.2.3:

  Bugs fixed:

    * Using alphanumeric variables in functions under AGGREGATE
      segfaulted.  Fixed.

    * Under certain circumstances, the final case would be omitted
      from the results of an AGGREGATE operation.  Fixed.

    * Undefined behavior was invoked by referencing a freed pointer
      under certain circumstances.  Fixed.

    * A wrong record size was displayed when paging the active file to
      disk.  Fixed.

    * Not having enough temporary space for sorting caused a core
      dump.  Fixed.

    * Syntax errors in function descriptions on AGGREGATE caused core
      dumps.  Fixed.

    * A null pointer was dereferenced, causing a core dump, when
      PERCENTILES was specified on FREQUENCIES.  This fixes the
      problem, but PSPP still doesn't calculate percentiles.

    * SORT always sorted in ascending order.  Fixed.

    * Some minor memory leaks in the expression parser were removed.

    * Many assertions fixed for strict ANSI C compliance.

  New features:

    * SET ECHO ON now implemented, but turned off by default.

    * PRINT specifier supported on END REPEAT.

  Other:

    * System libgmp2 library is used if installed instead of
      unconditionally using the included libgmp2 subset.

    * Extensive code cleanup, which continues.

    * Added CORRELATIONS command parser, but not implemented.

Version 0.2.3 changes since 0.2.2:

  Bugs fixed:

    * SPLIT FILE with a string variable caused a core dump.  Fixed.

    * Nested INCLUDEs didn't work.  Fixed.

    * The MATCH FILES procedure set the values of variables not present
      to 0.  It should have been SYSMIS.  This is now fixed.

    * The REMARK command was too aggressive about skipping lines.  It
      didn't like being the last command in a file.

    * Comment parsing wasn't consistent with the rest of the code in its
      idea of where one command ends and another starts.  This meant
      that sometimes commands would be mysteriously ignored.  Thanks to
      Dr. Dirk Melcher <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * The TABLE subcommand on MATCH FILES worked only erratically at
      best.  This fixes it.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * VARIABLE LABELS rejected a slash before the first variable
      specification, contradicting the documentation.  Thanks to Walter
      M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for reporting this bug.

    * Because of an incorrect optimization in memory allocation,
      CROSSTABS sometimes segfaulted when asked to output multiple
      tables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * CROSSTABS didn't display value labels for column and row
      variables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * WRITE didn't write line ends.  Fixed.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * The TABLE subcommand on MATCH FILES worked only erratically at
      best.  This fixes it.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * VARIABLE LABELS rejected a slash before the first variable
      specification, contradicting the documentation.  Thanks to Walter
      M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for reporting this bug.

    * Because of an incorrect optimization in memory allocation,
      CROSSTABS sometimes segfaulted when asked to output multiple
      tables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * CROSSTABS didn't display value labels for column and row
      variables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * WRITE didn't write line ends.  Fixed.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * MATCH FILES corrupted memory and dumped core on some syntax
      errors.  Fixed.

    * MATCH FILES should set numeric values not available to the
      system-missing value, not to 0.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * KEEP didn't work properly on the SAVE procedure.  Fixed.  Thanks
      to Ralf Geschke <ralf@kuerbis.org> for reporting this bug.

    * Memory leak fix.

    * Some systems didn't like the way open_file was coded.  Thanks to
      Hankin <hankin@rogue.consultco.com> for pointing this out.

    * The SAVE procedure didn't save long string variables properly.
      Fixed by this patch.  Thanks to Hankin
      <hankin@rogue.consultco.com> for this patch.

    * Minor documentation fixes for MATCH FILES.

Version 0.2.2 changes since 0.2.1:

  Bugs fixed:

    * Fix behavior of PRINT SPACE for negative arguments.

    * Fix reading some unusual system files.

    * Fix LIST problems with very long variables.  Thanks to Hankin
      <hankin@dunno.com> for this bug report.

    * Fix problems with some string format specifiers.

    * Fix use of $CASENUM in expressions.  Thanks to Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * Additional DATA LIST FREE and DATA LIST LIST fixes.  Thanks to
      Hankin <hankin@dunno.com> again on this one.

    * Sometimes you may encounter a PSPP script that has to be
      interpreted in interactive mode.  Now you can use the -i flag to
      do this.

    * Warnings for egcs 1.1.1 cleaned up.  (However you'll get lots of
      `unused variable' warnings under gcc 2.7.2.3, fixing this will
      take more effort.)

    * Tests fixed.

    * The files in gmp need the internationalization directory in
      their include path.  Thanks to OKUJI Yoshinori
      <okuji@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp> for pointing this out.

Version 0.2.1 changes since 0.2.0:

  Bugs fixed:

    * Remember to include examples/ directory in distribution :-)

    * Fixed gmp compile problems for some non-i386 architectures.
      Thanks to Hans Olav Eggestad <olav@jordforsk.nlh.no> and others
      for reporting this.

    * DATA LIST FREE and DATA LIST LIST parsing of input files is now
      matches the documented behavior exactly, and error messages are
      more helpful.  Thanks to Mark H. Wood <mwood@IUPUI.Edu>.
