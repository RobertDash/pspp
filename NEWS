Version 0.3.1 changes since 0.3.0:

  Update build system to Autoconf 2.58, Automake 1.7, gettext 0.12.1.

  T-TEST is now implemented.

  Much of the code has been rewritten and refactored.  It is now much
  cleaner.

Version 0.3.0 changes since 0.2.3:

  Bugs fixed:

    * Using alphanumeric variables in functions under AGGREGATE
      segfaulted.  Fixed.

    * Under certain circumstances, the final case would be omitted
      from the results of an AGGREGATE operation.  Fixed.

    * Undefined behavior was invoked by referencing a freed pointer
      under certain circumstances.  Fixed.

    * A wrong record size was displayed when paging the active file to
      disk.  Fixed.

    * Not having enough temporary space for sorting caused a core
      dump.  Fixed.

    * Syntax errors in function descriptions on AGGREGATE caused core
      dumps.  Fixed.

    * A null pointer was dereferenced, causing a core dump, when
      PERCENTILES was specified on FREQUENCIES.  This fixes the
      problem, but PSPP still doesn't calculate percentiles.

    * SORT always sorted in ascending order.  Fixed.

    * Some minor memory leaks in the expression parser were removed.

    * Many assertions fixed for strict ANSI C compliance.

  New features:

    * SET ECHO ON now implemented, but turned off by default.

    * PRINT specifier supported on END REPEAT.

  Other:

    * System libgmp2 library is used if installed instead of
      unconditionally using the included libgmp2 subset.

    * Extensive code cleanup, which continues.

    * Added CORRELATIONS command parser, but not implemented.

Version 0.2.3 changes since 0.2.2:

  Bugs fixed:

    * SPLIT FILE with a string variable caused a core dump.  Fixed.

    * Nested INCLUDEs didn't work.  Fixed.

    * The MATCH FILES procedure set the values of variables not present
      to 0.  It should have been SYSMIS.  This is now fixed.

    * The REMARK command was too aggressive about skipping lines.  It
      didn't like being the last command in a file.

    * Comment parsing wasn't consistent with the rest of the code in its
      idea of where one command ends and another starts.  This meant
      that sometimes commands would be mysteriously ignored.  Thanks to
      Dr. Dirk Melcher <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * The TABLE subcommand on MATCH FILES worked only erratically at
      best.  This fixes it.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * VARIABLE LABELS rejected a slash before the first variable
      specification, contradicting the documentation.  Thanks to Walter
      M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for reporting this bug.

    * Because of an incorrect optimization in memory allocation,
      CROSSTABS sometimes segfaulted when asked to output multiple
      tables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * CROSSTABS didn't display value labels for column and row
      variables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * WRITE didn't write line ends.  Fixed.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * The TABLE subcommand on MATCH FILES worked only erratically at
      best.  This fixes it.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * VARIABLE LABELS rejected a slash before the first variable
      specification, contradicting the documentation.  Thanks to Walter

      CROSSTABS sometimes segfaulted when asked to output multiple
      tables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for

    * CROSSTABS didn't display value labels for column and row
      variables.  Thanks to Walter M. Gray <graywm@northernc.on.ca> for
      reporting this bug.

    * WRITE didn't write line ends.  Fixed.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * MATCH FILES corrupted memory and dumped core on some syntax
      errors.  Fixed.

    * MATCH FILES should set numeric values not available to the
      system-missing value, not to 0.  Thanks to Dr. Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * KEEP didn't work properly on the SAVE procedure.  Fixed.  Thanks
      to Ralf Geschke <ralf@kuerbis.org> for reporting this bug.

    * Memory leak fix.

    * Some systems didn't like the way open_file was coded.  Thanks to
      Hankin <hankin@rogue.consultco.com> for pointing this out.

    * The SAVE procedure didn't save long string variables properly.
      Fixed by this patch.  Thanks to Hankin
      <hankin@rogue.consultco.com> for this patch.

    * Minor documentation fixes for MATCH FILES.

Version 0.2.2 changes since 0.2.1:

  Bugs fixed:

    * Fix behavior of PRINT SPACE for negative arguments.

    * Fix reading some unusual system files.

    * Fix LIST problems with very long variables.  Thanks to Hankin
      <hankin@dunno.com> for this bug report.

    * Fix problems with some string format specifiers.

    * Fix use of $CASENUM in expressions.  Thanks to Dirk Melcher
      <BZN-mdksh@t-online.de> for reporting this bug.

    * Additional DATA LIST FREE and DATA LIST LIST fixes.  Thanks to
      Hankin <hankin@dunno.com> again on this one.

    * Sometimes you may encounter a PSPP script that has to be
      interpreted in interactive mode.  Now you can use the -i flag to
      do this.

    * Warnings for egcs 1.1.1 cleaned up.  (However you'll get lots of
      `unused variable' warnings under gcc 2.7.2.3, fixing this will
      take more effort.)

    * Tests fixed.

    * The files in gmp need the internationalization directory in
      their include path.  Thanks to OKUJI Yoshinori
      <okuji@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp> for pointing this out.

Version 0.2.1 changes since 0.2.0:

  Bugs fixed:

    * Remember to include examples/ directory in distribution :-)

    * Fixed gmp compile problems for some non-i386 architectures.
      Thanks to Hans Olav Eggestad <olav@jordforsk.nlh.no> and others
      for reporting this.

    * DATA LIST FREE and DATA LIST LIST parsing of input files is now
      matches the documented behavior exactly, and error messages are
      more helpful.  Thanks to Mark H. Wood <mwood@IUPUI.Edu>.

Version 0.2.0 changes since 0.1.0:

    * CROSSTABS.  Please see documentation for caveats.
