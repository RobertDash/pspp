PSPP currently runs only as a console-mode application under Windows
environments.  Since Windows 3.1 does not provide a console, PSPP
needs special assistance to run under Windows 3.1.  con32s is a small
library that I have developed to do this.  This directory contains the
compiler-independent portion of con32s.  There is also a small
compiler-dependent portion that need to be written for each compiler.
See the example for Borland C++ for more details.
