We wish to thank current active contributors to PSPP:

* Ben Pfaff wrote the initial program and manual, which comprises the
majority of the current code. Ben continues to contribute and 
most of the core libraries which ensure that PSPP runs with optimal
speed are his work.

* John Darrington wrote the graphical user interface, and the T-TEST,
ONEWAY, EXAMINE, RANK and  NPAR TESTS commands, implemented support
for long variable names, psql and gnumeric and made numerous revisions
to other modules.   

* Jason Stover contributed statistical and numerical functionality,
including lib/gslextras and the linear regression features. Jason 
is also an important contributor to GSL, which is used by PSPP. 

* Harry Thijssen contributed and maintains the Dutch translation.

We also thank past contributors:

* John Williams wrote an initial draft of the T-TEST procedure.
